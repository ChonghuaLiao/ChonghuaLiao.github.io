    Hi, I am a 3rd-year CS Ph.D Student at IIIS, Tsinghua, advised by Prof. Huazhe Xu. I completed my bachelor's degree of Automation at Tsinghua University, with a minor in statistics. I am particularly intersted in NLP and RL. Specificially, I have done some work including LLM pretraining, multi-task learning, prompt searching, RL theory and differential privacy. Luckily, I have worked with Prof. Zhilin Yang and Prof. Quanquan Gu.  </p>
